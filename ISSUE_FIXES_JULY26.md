# Issue Fixes Completed - July 26, 2025

## ðŸŽ¯ Issues Addressed

### 1. âœ… Task Synchronization Fixed
**Problem**: Team members showing "0 tasks" in team display
**Root Cause**: Only counting `assignedTasks` (legacy) but missing `taskAssignments` (new many-to-many)
**Solution**: 
- Updated team page query to include both `assignedTasks` and `taskAssignments`
- Modified task counting logic to combine and deduplicate tasks from both sources
- Updated team API endpoints to fetch complete task assignment data

### 2. âœ… Profile Detail Page Created
**Problem**: "Profili GÃ¶rÃ¼ntÃ¼le" button leading to 404 error
**Solution**: 
- Created comprehensive user profile page at `/team/member/[id]/page.tsx`
- Added user API endpoint `/api/users/[id]` with full task and team data
- Included task statistics, team memberships, and performance metrics
- Added proper error handling and loading states

### 3. âœ… Enhanced Bottleneck Display
**Problem**: Bottleneck information not showing "0 bottlenecks" when none exist
**Solution**: 
- Added detailed monthly workload analysis section to calendar
- Shows bottleneck count (including "0 bottlenecks" when none)
- Added average workload, peak workload statistics
- Displays individual bottleneck days with details
- Shows encouraging message when no bottlenecks exist

## ðŸ”§ Technical Improvements

### Database Query Optimization
```typescript
// Before: Only legacy assignments
assignedTasks: { include: { project: true } }

// After: Both legacy and new assignments
assignedTasks: { include: { project: true } },
taskAssignments: { 
  include: { 
    task: { include: { project: true } } 
  } 
}
```

### Task Count Calculation
```typescript
// Combine and deduplicate tasks from both sources
const allUserTasks = [
  ...user.assignedTasks,
  ...user.taskAssignments.map(assignment => assignment.task)
];

const uniqueTasks = allUserTasks.filter((task, index, array) => 
  array.findIndex(t => t.id === task.id) === index
);
```

### Bottleneck Statistics
- **Monthly Analysis**: Shows bottleneck count, average workload, peak workload
- **Daily Breakdown**: Individual bottleneck days with workload percentages
- **Zero State Handling**: Positive messaging when no bottlenecks exist

## ðŸŽ¨ UI/UX Enhancements

### Profile Page Features
- **Personal Information**: Name, email, department, student ID
- **Task Statistics**: Active, completed, and total task counts
- **Team Memberships**: All teams the user belongs to
- **Task Breakdown**: Individual task details with status and priority
- **Navigation**: Back button and team links

### Calendar Improvements
- **Visual Indicators**: Red rings around bottleneck days
- **Detailed Stats**: Three-column statistics layout
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover tooltips for workload information
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop

## ðŸ“Š Current Status

âœ… **Team Task Sync**: Fixed - users now show correct task counts
âœ… **Profile Pages**: Working - comprehensive user detail pages
âœ… **Bottleneck Display**: Enhanced - shows 0-state and detailed analysis
âœ… **TypeScript Errors**: Resolved - all compilation issues fixed
âœ… **Production Deploy**: Complete - changes live at https://temsa-one.vercel.app
