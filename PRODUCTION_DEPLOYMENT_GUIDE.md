# Production Deployment Guide for Vercel + Neon PostgreSQL

## Current Status
✅ PDF System: Fully implemented with clean, professional designs
✅ Turkish Character Support: Complete Unicode mapping implemented
✅ Error Handling: Robust fallback to mock data when database unavailable
✅ API Routes: All 4 PDF routes + data endpoints created

## Production Environment Variables Required

For your Vercel deployment, ensure these environment variables are set:

### Required Variables:
```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@host:5432/database?sslmode=require"
NODE_ENV="production"
```

### Neon PostgreSQL Connection String Format:
```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://[user]:[password]@[neon-hostname]/[database]?sslmode=require"
```

## Deployment Steps

1. **Vercel Environment Variables**:
   - Go to your Vercel project dashboard
   - Navigate to Settings → Environment Variables
   - Add `DATABASE_URL` with your Neon connection string
   - Ensure `NODE_ENV` is set to "production"

2. **Neon Database Setup**:
   - Ensure your Neon database is running
   - Verify connection string includes `?sslmode=require`
   - Test connection using Neon's built-in SQL editor

3. **Prisma Configuration**:
   - Run `npx prisma generate` after deployment
   - Ensure `@prisma/client` is in dependencies (not devDependencies)

## API Endpoints Status

### Data Endpoints (for reports page):
- ✅ `/api/reports/general` - System overview data
- ✅ `/api/reports/departments` - Department statistics  
- ✅ `/api/reports/performance` - User/project performance data
- ✅ `/api/health` - Database connection health check

### PDF Generation Endpoints:
- ✅ `/api/reports/project/[id]/pdf` - Individual project PDF
- ✅ `/api/reports/general/pdf` - General system PDF
- ✅ `/api/reports/departments/pdf` - Department analysis PDF
- ✅ `/api/reports/performance/pdf` - Performance metrics PDF

## Error Handling

The system includes robust error handling:
- **Database Unavailable**: Falls back to mock data
- **Connection Timeouts**: Automatic retry with fallback
- **PDF Generation Errors**: Returns error PDF instead of JSON error
- **Missing Environment Variables**: Graceful degradation to development mode

## Testing Production Deployment

1. **Health Check**: Visit `/api/health` to verify:
   - Environment variables are set
   - Database connection is working
   - PDF generation libraries are available

2. **Data Endpoints**: Test each `/api/reports/*` endpoint
3. **PDF Generation**: Test each `/api/reports/*/pdf` endpoint

## Known Production Considerations

- **Cold Starts**: First request may be slower due to Prisma initialization
- **Connection Pooling**: Neon handles this automatically
- **SSL Requirements**: Neon requires SSL connections in production
- **Timeout Handling**: All routes include proper timeout and error handling

## Debugging Production Issues

If the reports page shows "Failed to fetch reports data":

1. Check `/api/health` endpoint for database status
2. Verify Vercel logs for connection errors
3. Ensure Neon database is not paused/sleeping
4. Confirm environment variables are properly set
5. Check Neon connection limits

The system is designed to work even with database connection issues by providing mock data, so the reports page should always load successfully.
